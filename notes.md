## GitHub Notes

Learned how to setup a GitHub repository and use the commit, push, and pull functions. Also was able to configure Gitlens in VS code, should make visuals easier compared to the terminal. Started reading up on the documentation for writing markdown. Similar to Discords syntax for bolding, italics, etc. Seems to be fairly simple to understand. Heres a [Link](https://github.com/JagarJaguar/startup) to my repo for reference.
