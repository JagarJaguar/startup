## GitHub Notes

Learned how to setup a GitHub repository and use the commit, push, and pull functions. Also was able to configure Gitlens in VS code, should make visuals easier compared to the terminal. Started reading up on the documentation for writing markdown. Similar to Discords syntax for bolding, italics, etc. Seems to be fairly simple to understand. Heres a [Link](https://github.com/JagarJaguar/startup) to my repo for reference.

## Startup Notes

While working on the startup deliverable, I had to think about how I wanted to design the website and what I wanted to include in technologies. Thinking about what technologies I wanted to include took the most time, and I am not too sure if I did that correctly, but I tried to include what the examples showed. My sketch for the design is not very pretty, I am no artist and I could not get NinjaMock to work, so I used the notes app on my iPad to design a simple sketch. This website should be fairly simple overall. I expect implementing the emojis to be the most difficult part though. I plan to make changes to the startup if needed.

## AWS Notes

Going to start using bulletpoints to make things easier since it is a lot to cover by typing sentences.
- Made AWS Instance using t3.micro, may change later to allocate more power.
- Associated an elastic IP to my instance in AWS.
- Website works using HTTP!
