### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure to layout website. There will be 3 HTML pages: One for login, one for chatting, and one for an about page.
- **CSS** - Uses good contrasting colors, will work accross different devices and aspect ratios. Ueses correct whitespace that looks neat and is easy to read.
- **React** - Provides login functionality, message display, sending messages, emoji selection, page selection, and the use of React for routing and other needed components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - sending messages
    - viewing messages
    - use [EmojiHub](https://github.com/cheatsnake/emojihub) to have emoji selections
- **DB/Login** - Stores users sent messages in database. Register and login users. User credentials stored in a secure database. Users cannot send messages until they have signed in.
- **WebSocket** - As users send messages, other users on the website can view their messages in real-time.
