### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure to layout website. There will be 3 HTML pages: One for login, one for chatting, and one for an about page.
- **CSS** - Uses good contrasting colors, will work accross different devices and aspect ratios. Ueses correct whitespace that looks neat and is easy to read.
- **React** - Provides login functionality, message display, sending messages, emoji selection, page selection, and the use of React for routing and other needed components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - sending messages
    - viewing messages
    - use [EmojiHub](https://github.com/cheatsnake/emojihub) to have emoji selections
- **DB/Login** - Stores users sent messages in database. Register and login users. User credentials stored in a secure database. Users cannot send messages until they have signed in.
- **WebSocket** - As users send messages, other users on the website can view their messages in real-time.

- [x] **HTML pages** - 3 different pages for website functionality: `index.html`, `chat.html`, and `about.html`
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - I spent a while figuring out how to structure my HTML. I spent quite a bit of time learning what each of the elements do to format my HTML correctly. Especially the `<textarea>` element since I had to figure out how to format it properly to look like a chatbox.
- [x] **Links** - Added links for all 3 pages. All pages link to each other.
- [x] **Text** - About page has text.

- [x] **Login placeholder** - 2 forms for login on `index.html`, one for the username, and one for the password.
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - Message history stored in the textarea placeholder in `chat.html` as well as user login data.
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - Users can send messages in real-time in the placeholder text input area in `chat.html`.

- [x] **Application text content** - All text uses same font, shadows on text elements as well.
- [x] **Application images** - Added styling to my image on my about page (sort of like a frame), also added a frame around the emoji 3rd party API placeholder.
