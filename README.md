    - Chat history is saved

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure to layout website. There will be 3 HTML pages: One for login, one for chatting, and one for an about page.
- **CSS** - Uses good contrasting colors, will work accross different devices and aspect ratios. Ueses correct whitespace that looks neat and is easy to read.
- **React** - Provides login functionality, message display, sending messages, emoji selection, page selection, and the use of React for routing and other needed components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - sending messages
    - viewing messages
    - use [EmojiHub](https://github.com/cheatsnake/emojihub) to have emoji selections
- **DB/Login** - Stores users sent messages in database. Register and login users. User credentials stored in a secure database. Users cannot send messages until they have signed in.
- **WebSocket** - As users send messages, other users on the website can view their messages in real-time.

## ðŸš€ HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **HTML pages** - 3 different pages for website functionality: `index.html`, `chat.html`, and `about.html`
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - I spent a while figuring out how to structure my HTML. I spent quite a bit of time learning what each of the elements do to format my HTML correctly. Especially the `<textarea>` element since I had to figure out how to format it properly to look like a chatbox.
- [x] **Links** - Added links for all 3 pages. All pages link to each other.
- [x] **Text** - About page has text.
- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - About page has placeholder for a 3rd party emojicon API (will also be used for emoji selection for the actual chat if the websocket doesn't have a selection).
- [x] **Images** - Added an image to the about page. Gives an insight into the author and what they like. 
- [x] **Login placeholder** - 2 forms for login on `index.html`, one for the username, and one for the password.
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - Message history stored in the textarea placeholder in `chat.html` as well as user login data.
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - Users can send messages in real-time in the placeholder text input area in `chat.html`.

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - Added styling to the header, footer (bootstrap), and main body.
- [x] **Navigation elements** - Centered navigation menu, added bolding to elements that you are selected on as well as underline. Made text white as well.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - Application is responsive to different window resizing and devices.
- [x] **Application elements** - Added styling and centered everything to make it more cohesive and easier on the eyes. Added shadowing to where it was applicable, used good spacing between different elements.
- [x] **Application text content** - All text uses same font, shadows on text elements as well.
- [x] **Application images** - Added styling to my image on my about page (sort of like a frame), also added a frame around the emoji 3rd party API placeholder.

## ðŸš€ React part 1: Routing deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Bundled using Vite** - Installed Vite and other necessary packages.
- [x] **Components** Login (Home), Chat, and about are all replaced with React components and placeholders are kept. All `class` properties were replaced with `className`.
    - **Login** - Both login buttons take you to the chat page.
    - **Chat** - I had to re-do some of the HTML and CSS, but it is mostly the same. Changed the textarea tag before to `htmlFor` for JSX. Placeholder for sending messages, using emojis, and chat history.
    - **About** - 3rd party emoji API placeholder is still there, all previous elements are where they are supposed to be.
    - **Not Found** - Added a not found page.
- [x] **Router** - Routing between login, chat, and about.

## ðŸš€ React part 2: Reactivity

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** - Login/Create account functionality saves to localstorage. Chat messages send and show up, messages saved to localstorage. 3rd party emoji API placeholder functionality mocked out, using random emojis as placeholder.
- [x] **Hooks** - Used `useEffect` and `useState` in the about page & chat page. Used `useState` and `useNavigate` for the login page to control login functionality.

## ðŸš€ Service deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - Express server created in `/service/index.js` that listens for connections/sends back data.
- [x] **Static middleware for frontend** - Used `express.static('public')` to serve the frontend.
- [x] **Calls to third party endpoints** - Call to apiNinjas API in for the about page. Cycles through random face emojis and displays them.
- [x] **Backend service endpoints** -  Implemented authentication (`/api/auth/*`), message retrieval (`/api/messages`), and message sending (`/api/message`).
- [x] **Frontend calls service endpoints** - The frontend makes API calls for authentication and messaging. `App.jsx` calls (`/api/messages`) to check if `/chat` can be viewed from navigation since you have to be authenticated anyways.

## ðŸš€ DB/Login deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **User registration** - Users can create an account which is stored in MongoDB, will throw error if user already exists in database.
- [x] **User login and logout** - Users can login to their accounts using their username and password. Will throw an error if credentials are incorrect or user does not exist.
- [x] **Stores data in MongoDB** - User messages are stored in MongoDB.
- [x] **Stores credentials in MongoDB** - User data is stored in MongoDB.
- [x] **Restricts functionality based on authentication** - Users cannot access chat unless they are logged in. The `verifyAuth` middleware prevents unauthenticated users from accessing `/messages` or `/message`.
